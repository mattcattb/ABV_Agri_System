# ABV Camera Monitoring System

This project aims to provide stable control over a camera monitoring system for research use. 

## Project Overview

This project has 2 switch parts:
- Data Collection Switch: Activates and saves images at 30FPS to external storage on toggle. 
- Model Prediction Switch: (In Progress) Runs YOLOv8 image prediction model every 5 seconds, saving on external storage.

## Control Flow

Before starting system, only plug in one USB. This will be SDA. Do not remove this while the system is turned on. 

<p> The green light will blink to show that startup has began. When the light turns green, the system has began.

<p> If at any moment one of the red or blue lights is blinking, this is **blocking mode**. Turn each switch till they are both turned off. This will exit blocking mode.

**Green:** Main System Running <br>
**Blue:** Data Collection script on, taking images and storing onto hardrive<br>
**Red:** YOLO Model making inferences <br>
<p>
L_Switch: Begin Data Collection <br>
R_Switch: Begin Inferencing <br>
<p>

When Using inferencing mode, wait a bit for the system to begin inferences. When turned off, wait till it finishes blinking before using data collection mode.

Start with both switches at off.

**Do not turn on both at once!** <br>
This will lead to blocking mode, which will force you to turn off both switches before continuing

When finished, turn off the system and only then unplug the USB.
