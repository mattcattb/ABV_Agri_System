# ABV Camera Monitoring System

This project provides stable control over a camera monitoring system for research use.

## Project Overview

This system includes two main components:
- **Data Collection Switch**: Activates and saves images at 30 FPS to external storage when toggled.
- **Model Prediction Switch**: (In Progress) Runs the YOLOv8 image prediction model every 5 seconds, saving results to external storage.

## Control Flow

1. **Startup**: 
   - Plug in only one USB (SDA) before starting. Do not remove this while the system is on.
   - The green light will blink during startup. When it turns solid green, the system is ready.

2. **Blocking Mode**: 
   - If the red or blue lights are blinking, the system is in blocking mode. Toggle both switches off to exit.
   - **Green**: Main system running  
   - **Blue**: Data collection active (storing images)  
   - **Red**: YOLO model making inferences  

3. **Switches**:  
   - **L_Switch**: Begin data collection  
   - **R_Switch**: Begin inferencing 

4. **Usage**: 
   - Start with both switches off. Do not activate both switches simultaneously, as this will cause blocking mode.

5. **Data Collection**: 
   - Data collection takes pictures at 30 FPS and stores them in one of the run folders.

6. **Inferencing**: 
   - Inferencing mode starts running the YOLOv8 model on all of the pictures taken and stored from data collection. Do not run before data collection is done.

7. **Shutdown**: 
   - Turn off the system and then unplug the USB.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Jetson Nano (Jetpack SDK)
- USB Camera
- RGB lights (Red, Blue, Green)
- 2 Switches

### Software
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Archiconda
- Nanocamera
- Python 3.8
- Python services
- python3-jetson-gpio
- exFAT (install via `sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils`)

### Setup

1. **Download and Setup Conda Environment**:
   - Create environment and install NanoCamera, OpenCV, and Jetson GPIO libraries.

2. **Setup Services**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x setup_services.sh
   chmod +x start_main_script.sh
   chmod +x usb_mount.sh
   ./setup_services.sh
   ```
   This will copy all services to the services section and enable them.

3. **Run Software**:
   - Your setup is now complete! Reboot your Jetson or unplug and replug the USB to see the light start blinking.

This should provide a clear and understandable set of instructions for using the ABV Camera Monitoring System.
